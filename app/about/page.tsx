    title: "Surface Preparation is Key",
    content: "The secret to a flawless paint job lies in thorough preparation. Before any paint touches your walls, our team meticulously cleans, sands, fills holes and cracks, and primes surfaces. This essential groundwork ensures paint adheres properly and lasts for years without peeling or bubbling. Skipping preparation is the most common mistake in DIY painting projects.",
  },
  {
    title: "Understanding Paint Finishes",
    content: "Different rooms require different paint finishes. Flat and matte finishes hide imperfections and work well for ceilings and low-traffic areas. Eggshell and satin finishes offer a subtle sheen perfect for living rooms and bedrooms. Semi-gloss and gloss finishes are ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, and trim as they're easy to clean and resist moisture.",
  },
  {
    title: "Colour Psychology in Home Design",
    content: "Colours profoundly affect mood and perception. Blues and greens create calm, relaxing environments ideal for bedrooms. Warm yellows and oranges energize spaces like kitchens and dining rooms. Neutral tones provide versatility and make rooms feel larger. Our colour consultants help you choose palettes that achieve your desired atmosphere.",
  },
  {
    title: "Weather Considerations for Exterior Painting",
    content: "Sydney's climate significantly impacts exterior painting projects. Ideal painting conditions are between 10-30°C with low humidity and no rain forecast for 24-48 hours. Spring and autumn typically offer the best conditions. We carefully monitor weather patterns to ensure optimal application and drying for lasting results.",
  },

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How long does a typical house painting project take?",
    answer: "The duration depends on the project size and scope. A single room typically takes 1-2 days, while a full interior repaint of an average Sydney home takes 4-7 days. Exterior painting usually requires 5-10 days depending on the home's size and condition. We provide accurate timelines during our free quote consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of paint do you use?",
    answer: "We exclusively use premium quality paints from trusted Australian brands like Dulux, Taubmans, and Haymes. These paints offer superior coverage, durability, and colour retention. We select the appropriate paint type (water-based or oil-based) based on the surface and location. All our paints are low-VOC for better indoor air quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer colour consultation services?",
    answer: "Yes! Our experienced colour consultants help you navigate the thousands of available colours to find the perfect palette for your space. We consider factors like natural light, room size, existing furnishings, and your personal style. This complimentary service ensures you're confident in your colour choices before we begin.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are you fully licensed and insured?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Majestic Painting is fully licensed and carries comprehensive insurance including public liability and workers' compensation. This protects both our team and your property. We're also members of the Master Painters Association, demonstrating our commitment to industry standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you protect furniture and floors during painting?",
    answer: "We take extensive precautions to protect your belongings. This includes moving furniture to the centre of rooms and covering with drop sheets, laying protective coverings on floors, masking off fixtures and fittings, and sealing doorways to prevent dust spread. After completion, we thoroughly clean up, leaving your space spotless.",
  },
  {
    question: "What preparation work is included in your service?",
    answer: "Comprehensive preparation is included in every quote. This covers washing and cleaning surfaces, sanding rough areas, filling cracks and holes, scraping loose paint, applying primer where needed, and caulking gaps. Proper preparation is essential for a professional, long-lasting finish.",
